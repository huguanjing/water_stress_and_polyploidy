# Stress response to salinity in diploid and polyploid cotton
## Objectives
Soil salinity is a severe abiotic stress causing major decrease in crop productivity and limiting the geographic distribution of many  plant species. The aims with the present study are:
* To examine some important phenotypic traits that contributed to salt tolerance in cotton.
* To evaluate salt tolerance difference among A genome, D genome, and AD genome cottons. 
* To compare the salinity tolerance between diploid and allotetraploid cottons.
* To understand if cultivation effects the salt tolerance of cottons (comparions between wild and cultivated cottons).
* To understand which subgenome (A2 or D5) contibutes more to the AD genome cottons under control and salt tress conditions.
 
## Plant Materials
17 accessions from 12 species were used. See [accessions](accessions.md) for detailed descriptions
## Methods
See [protocols](protocols.md) for detailed descriptions.
### Hydroponic system
We will use a floating raft system as demonstrated by this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-ou5iUHtvg). Materials include:
* 6-8 inch deep tubs
* 2 inch thick styrofoam (expanded Polystyrene Foam) board. [Menards](https://www.menards.com/main/building-materials/insulation/insulation-panels/expanded-polystyrene-foam-insulation-2-x-4-x-8-r-8/p-1444435971902-c-5779.htm?tid=9154814912926552425&ipos=11) 
* 2 inch net cups: [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01EQFGS6O/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
* [Rockwool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral_wool) - a versatile soilless growing medium. We will use [1.5" cubes](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B016AXFAY6/ref=s9_acsd_hps_bw_c_x_1_w) to start seedlings and root cuttings. See more info in [grodan website](http://grodan101.com)

### Stress Phenotyping
We analyzed 14 phenotype traits of cotton under control and salt tress including:
* Growth related traits
  * Shoot growth
  * Relative water content (RWC)
* Antioxidative enzymes and lipid peroxidation 
  * Superoxide dismutase (SOD)
  * Peroxidase (POD)
  * Malonaldehyde (MDA)
* Gas exchange parameter and chlorophyll content
  * net photosynthetic rate (Pn)
  * stomatal conductance (Cond)
  * internal CO2 concentration (Ci) 
  * transpiration rate (Tr)
  * Water unse efficiency (WUE)
  * Chla+Chlb content
  * Chla content
  * Chlb content
  * Chla/Chlb
_ _ _
 To be completed
* Ion contents measurement including Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>/Na<sup>+</sup> raito, *etc*.
