# Stress response to salinity and drought in diploid and polyploid cotton
## Plant Materials
## Methods
See [protocols](protocols.md) for detailed descriptions.
### Hydroponic system
We will use a floating raft system as demonstrated by this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-ou5iUHtvg). Materials include:
* 6-8 inch deep tubs
* 2 inch thick styrofoam (expanded Polystyrene Foam) board. [Menards](https://www.menards.com/main/building-materials/insulation/insulation-panels/expanded-polystyrene-foam-insulation-2-x-4-x-8-r-8/p-1444435971902-c-5779.htm?tid=9154814912926552425&ipos=11) 
* 2 inch net cups: [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01EQFGS6O/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
* [Rockwool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral_wool) - a versatile soilless growing medium. We will use [1.5" cubes](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B016AXFAY6/ref=s9_acsd_hps_bw_c_x_1_w) to start seedlings and root cuttings. See more info in [grodan website](http://grodan101.com)
