# Protocols

## Seed germination
The fiber seeds were delinted by acid wash (aka, acid delinting). Briefly, a handful of seeds are soaked in sulfuric acid (dilution not required) in glass petri dish quickly, followed by three rinses in tab water. During acid wash, tiny bubbles form around seeds as fibers are dissolved in acid; the acid wash process is rather quick, only a few seconds (no longer than 30 seconds) depending on the amount of seeds and the fibers attached. Acid washed seeds were quickly transfered into a 500mL beaker full of tab water for rinses. It usually take 3-4 minutes for three rinses; it is optional to check if pH=7 is reached during last wash.

Delinted seeds were dried with paper towel, chipped and placed on germination paper in petri dish at 28-30C. It seems important to keep germination paper moist, by add water twice a day. It usually takes 2-4 days for cotton seeds to germinate. 

## Plant growth conditions and salt treatment
After germination, seeds were inserted into distill water holding by a foam borad covered with cheese cloth for around 7 days. Seedlings were transferred into hydroponic containers containing 1/4 strength MS medium and grown in the Bessy Hall Greenhouse at Iowa State University. Two-week-old uniform seedlings were selected and randomly divided into three groups. For salt stress groups, nutrient solutions were identical to that for controls except for the addition of NaC1 to the desired concentrations, i.e., 50mM and 100mM. The introduction of NaCl into solution was in gradual manner with daily increments for one week. The whole salt treatment process lasted for two weeks. Solutions were replaced twice a week.

## Phenotyping

### Measurement of plant growth
Individual plant height was recorded before and after salt treatment. Plant height (cm) was measured from the base of hypocotyl to the base of the youngest fully expanded leaf. The relative shoot growth was calculated as the difference of plant height before and after salt treatment. 

### Measurement of the Relative Water Content (RWC)
Leaf fresh weight (FW) was measured immediately after sample collection, and the sample was then left to saturate in water for 24 h at 4◦C before measuring the turgid weight (TW). The samples were oven dried at 80◦C for 24 h and weighed (DW). RWC was calculated as
follows: RWC = (FW– DW)/ (TW– DW).

### Measurement of antioxidative enzymes and lipid peroxidation
For extraction of enzymes and lipid peroxidation, 500 mg of pooled fresh leaves in each replicate were ground using mortar-pestle with liquid nitrogen and subsequently homogenized in 5 ml 0.2M PBS (pH7.0). Homogenate was centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 30 min at 4◦C and supernatant was collected for further assay. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) content was estimated according to inhibition of nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) method by [Giannopolitis et al](http://sci-hub.tw/10.1104/pp.59.2.315). In this study, one enzyme unit of SOD was defined as the amount of enzyme which could cause 50 % inhibition of NBT reduction. Peroxidase (POD) activity was measured by Guaicol method ([Zhou and Leul, 1999](http://sci-hub.tw/10.1023/A:1006165603300)). One enzyme unit is defined as change in 1 unit of absorbance every minute. Malonaldehyde (MDA) was measured as index of lipid peroxidation by trichloroacetic acid method described by [Zhang et al](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0112807&type=printable).

### Measurement of gas exchange parameters
After two weeks of salt treatment, measurement of photosynthetic gas exchange parameters was performed on the 5-6 seedlings of each accession. The portable open gas system Li-6400 (LI-COR Biosciences Inc., USA) was used to determine the net photosynthetic rate (Pn), stomatal conductance (Cond), internal CO2 concentration (Ci), and transpiration rate (Tr) of cottons on the second fully-expanded true leaf during 9:00-12:00 AM under photosynthetic active radiation (PAR) of 500 μmol m<sup>–2</sup>·s<sup>–1</sup>. Each seedling was measured for three times. Water use efficiency (WUE) was calculated as the ratio of Pn to Tr.

### Measurement of Chlorophyll Content 
For chlorophyll content, 100mg fresh functional leaves were cut into small segments and immersed in 5 ml 80% acetone solution for 48h in dark. Then the absorbances of supernatant were recorded at 663 and 645 nm using a spectrophotometer (DU 800, Beckman, Coulter, Inc., 250 S. Kraemer Boulevard Brea, CA 92821, USA). Chlorophyll a (Chl a), chlorophyll b (Chl b) and total chlorophylls (Chl) were estimated using the equations of [Porra et al](http://www.chem.ucla.edu/dept/Faculty/merchant/pdf/porra_et_al_1989.pdf).

### Measurement of Na+, K+ and Ca2+ Content
The Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> content will be measured at the College of Life Science, Zhejiang University. For ion contents measurement, fresh tissues will be washed with distilled water immediately after collection, dried at 60◦C for 72 h, and ground into a fine powder using a mortar and pestle. Approximately 200–500mg of powder from each genotype will be added to 12mL of 65% HNO3 and 2mL of 30% H2O2 and incubated at 80◦C for 1 h. Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations of the leaves will be determined by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (Optima 2100 DV; Perkin-Elmer, Inc., Massachusetts, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
