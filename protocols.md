# Protocols

## Seed germination
The fiber seeds were delinted by acid wash (aka, acid delinting). Briefly, a handful of seeds are soaked in sulfuric acid (dilution not required) in glass petri dish quickly, followed by three rinses in tab water. During acid wash, tiny bubbles form around seeds as fibers are dissolved in acid; the acid wash process is rather quick, only a few seconds (no longer than 30 seconds) depending on the amount of seeds and the fibers attached. Acid washed seeds were quickly transfered into a 500mL beaker full of tab water for rinses. It usually take 3-4 minutes for three rinses; it is optional to check if pH=7 is reached during last wash.

Delinted seeds were dried with paper towel, chipped and placed on germination paper in petri dish at 28-30C. It seems important to keep germination paper moist, by add water twice a day. It usually takes 2-4 days for cotton seeds to germinate.

## Phenotyping (to be modified )
RWC and REL were tested and calculated as previously described (Cao et al., 2007; Katam et al., 2016). Below from Gong_iTRAQ_2017.

### Measurement of the Relative Water Content (RWC)
Leaf fresh weight (FW) was measured immediately after sample collection, and the sample was then left to saturate in water for 8 h at 4◦C before measuring the turgid weight (TW). The samples were oven dried at 80◦C for 24 h and weighed (DW). RWC was calculated as
follows: RWC = (FW– DW)/ (TW– DW).

### Measurement of Relative Electrolyte Leakage (REL)
For REL, 0.5 g of fresh leaves were cut into discs 0.8 cm in diameter, placed in 40mL of ddH2O, and incubated at room temperature for 4 h. Then, electrical conductivity of the solution (C1) was measured using a conductivity meter (EM38, ICT international, Armidale, NSW, Australia). The solution was boiled for 10min and cooled to room temperature, and electrical conductivity (C2) was again measured. REL was calculated as REL = C1/C2.

### Measurement of Chlorophyll Content, 
For chlorophyll content, 0.2 g of fresh leaves was incubated in 20mL of 80% acetone in the dark at 4◦C overnight. After centrifugation at 5,000 × g and 4◦C for 5min, absorbance of the supernatant was measured at 663 and 645 nm using a spectrophotometer (DU 800, Beckman, Coulter, Inc., 250 S. Kraemer Boulevard Brea, CA 92821, USA). Chlorophyll content was calculated as total chlorophyll content = 2.03 D645 + 0.804 D663.

### Measurement of Na+, K+ and Ca2+ Content
To measure Na+, K+, and Ca2+ content, fresh tissues were washed with distilled water immediately after collection, dried at 60◦C for 72 h, and ground into a fine powder using a mortar and pestle. Approximately 200–500mg of powder from each genotype was added to 12mL of 65% HNO3 and 2mL of 30% H2O2 and incubated at 80◦C for 1 h. Na+, K+ and Ca2+ concentrations of the leaves were determined by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (Optima 2100 DV; Perkin-Elmer, Inc., Massachusetts, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.




* photosynthetic rate, 
* leaf relative water content
* Na+/K+ ratio
* free proline content
* levels of superoxide dismutase (Xu et al. 2013; Zhang et al. 2016b; Wei et al. 2017). 

Seedling growth at the beginning and end of stress treatments will be photographed and measured. Entire roots will be scanned with a large-area, high-resolution photo scanner (Epson Perfection V800 Pro) for image analysis using WinRHIZOTM (Regent Instruments, Inc.; Canada) to calculate total root length, surface area, volume, and average root diameter. Water status after treatment will be measured by leaf relative water content following an established protocol (Barrs and Weatherley 1962). Leaf photosynthesis, carbon assimilation and water transpiration rate will be measured using the LI-6400XT Portable Photosynthesis System (Li-COR Inc., NE, USA). Concentrations of Na+ and K+ in roots and leaves will be measured on the Spectro Ciros CCD ICP-AES spectrometer (SPECTRO, Germany) at the ISU Soil and Plant Analysis Laboratory. To estimate relative stress injury in terms of chlorophyll breakdown, leaf chlorophyll content will be determined as described by Arnon (1949). To measure osmotic adjustment, free proline content will be determined as described by Carillo et al. (2011). Total antioxidative capacity (Saleh and Plieth 2009) and the levels of single antioxidant species, including superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT),  peroxidase (POD), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), and glutathione reductase (GR), will be determined as described (Zhang et al. 2014). All spectrophotometrical and luminescence assays will be performed on the Bio-tek Synergy™ HT Multi-Detection Microplate Reader (BioTek, VT, USA) at the ISU Bessey Hall core facility. Our preliminary analyses of seedlings found that salt treatment stunted plant growth, reduced photosynthesis, and decreased defense-related enzyme activities more in diploids than in allopolyploids, an exciting result relative to our hypothesis regarding niche evolution and the importance of polyploidy (see Gossypium as a model).
